# Troubleshoot Application Networking within EKS As Non-Root User

This guide uses a NonRoot User Ephemeral Container approach to provide a secure solution for non-root users to conduct network diagnostics without compromising system integrity or security. This methodology involves deploying ephemeral containers designed for temporary tasks, such as utilizing tcpdump and tshark for network traffic analysis. These containers offer an isolated environment, ensuring that troubleshooting activities do not affect the host system. Running these tools within such containers necessitates specific Linux capabilities, notably CAP_NET_RAW for packet capturing and, when absolutely necessary, CAP_NET_ADMIN for more comprehensive network administrative tasks. This approach not only adheres to security best practices by limiting user privileges and avoiding privileged escalation but also aligns with compliance standards, contributing to a secure, standardized container ecosystem. Ephemeral containers are particularly advantageous for their resource efficiency, rapid deployment, and the clean slate they offer for each task, enhancing both the security and efficiency of network troubleshooting processes.
