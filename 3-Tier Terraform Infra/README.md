Project 1 - How to deploy a highly available three-tier architecture in AWS using Terraform

Deploying a highly available three-tier architecture in AWS can be a challenging task, but with the right tools and approach, it can be made more manageable. Terraform is one such tool that can help simplify the process of deploying infrastructure in AWS. In this article, we will explore how to deploy a highly available three-tier architecture in AWS using Terraform.

Three-tier architecture is a popular architectural pattern for building scalable and resilient web applications. The three-tier architecture consists of three layers: presentation, application, and database layers. Each layer has its own set of servers, which communicate with each other to deliver the web application to end-users.
The presentation layer is responsible for handling user requests and rendering the web pages. The application layer processes user requests and generates dynamic content, while the database layer stores and retrieves data.

To deploy a highly available three-tier architecture in AWS, we will need to use multiple Availability Zones (AZs) and ensure that all layers of the architecture are fault-tolerant. Terraform can help automate the process of creating and managing infrastructure in AWS, including creating resources in multiple AZs and configuring them for high availability. Below is an example of the services used to deploy a three-tier architecture in AWS:


Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC): A virtual network that allows you to launch Amazon Web Services resources into a virtual network that you define.
Amazon Internet Gateway (IGW): A gateway that enables communication between resources in your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and the internet.
Amazon Elastic Load Balancer (ELB): A load balancer service that automatically distributes incoming traffic across multiple targets.
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2): A scalable compute service that provides virtual machines (instances) in the cloud.
Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS): A managed database service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud.

Step 1: Design the architecture
The first step in deploying a highly available three-tier architecture is to design the architecture. This involves deciding on the number of instances for each layer and choosing the appropriate instance types, storage, and networking configurations. It is essential to consider scalability, performance, and cost when designing the architecture.

Step 2: Create the Terraform code
Once the architecture is designed, the next step is to create the Terraform code. Terraform uses a declarative language to define the infrastructure as code, allowing us to define the desired state of the infrastructure and then apply it to create or modify the resources. In this step, we will create a Terraform module for each layer of the architecture. The module will define the resources required for that layer, such as EC2 instances, security groups, and load balancers. We will also define the necessary networking configurations, such as subnets and route tables.

Step 3: Deploy the infrastructure
With the Terraform code created, the next step is to deploy the infrastructure. Terraform will create the necessary resources in AWS, including EC2 instances, load balancers, and security groups. To ensure high availability, we will deploy the infrastructure in multiple AZs. This will involve creating resources in each AZ and configuring them to communicate with each other. We will also set up auto-scaling groups for each layer to ensure that the infrastructure can scale up or down based on demand.

Step 4: Test and monitor the infrastructure
After deploying the infrastructure, it is essential to test and monitor it to ensure that it is working correctly. We can use tools such as AWS CloudWatch to monitor the performance of the infrastructure and identify any issues that may arise.
We should also conduct load testing to ensure that the infrastructure can handle the expected load. Load testing can help us identify any performance issues and optimize the infrastructure for better performance.

Conclusion
Deploying a highly available three-tier architecture in AWS using Terraform requires careful planning and configuration. With the right approach and tools, we can create a scalable and resilient infrastructure that can handle the demands of modern web applications. Terraform provides a powerful and flexible platform for managing infrastructure in AWS, allowing us to automate the process of creating and managing resources, saving time and resources in the long run.

Below are some examples of the infra deployed to create the three-tier architecture and their corresponding terraform files.

Create a VPC
The first step is to create a VPC that will host the three tiers of the architecture. In Terraform, you can use the aws_vpc resource to define the VPC. You can specify the CIDR block and any other desired attributes. For example vpc.tf

Create public and private subnets
Next, we need to create public and private subnets within the VPC. The public subnets will host the load balancer and the instances in the presentation tier. The private subnets will host the instances in the application and data tiers. In Terraform, you can use the aws_subnet resource to define the subnets. For example subnets.tf

Create a security group for the load balancer
To allow traffic to the load balancer, we need to create a security group that allows inbound traffic on port 80 (HTTP) and port 443 (HTTPS). In Terraform, you can use the aws_security_group resource to define the security group. For example web_sg.tf

Create an Application Load Balancer
Now that we have created the VPC, subnets, and security group, we can create an Application Load Balancer. In Terraform, you can use the aws_lb and aws_lb_target_group resources to define the load balancer and target group. For example alb.tf

Create EC2 instances for the presentation and application tiers
Next, we need to create EC2 instances for the presentation and application tiers. In Terraform, you can use the aws_instance resource to define the instances. For example ec2_instance.tf

Create an RDS instance for the data tier
Finally, we need to create an RDS instance for the data tier. In Terraform, you can use the aws_db_instance resource to define the RDS instance. For example rds.tf
